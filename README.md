    - What is myRemote? (when reading this people should understand 'why' to use it, if it fits their needs)
myRemote is a free and open source tool to connect you to all your devices from a simple webinterface, which you can access anywhere, anytime. Take screenshots of your desktop, execute a range of useful scripts we made for you [FIXME: give some examples here], or create your own custom scripts if you want more freedom to do anything you want. 

   - Isn't controlling all my devices from a website really unsafe? Why should i trust you?
Controlling your devices over the web is always dangerous. Therefor myRemote uses a secure connection from client to server. This is also known as SSL, and it gets your traffic safely to the other side. 
To keep your account safe, we have a few in built options, if you are logged into your account, you can see a logbook where you can see from what IP and location your account was used from. In case you see a different IP, we advise you to change your password.
We are also working to get a two-side authentication system. This is still in alpha testing, but myremote.io will be updated soon.

    - What do I need to use myRemote?
Two things:
- The myRemote client on the devices you want to be able to control. Supported OS'es are: Windows, OSX and Linux. Note that you will also need Python(2.7) to use the client.
- An account on myremote.io. Registration is currently not yet open, but you can request an invite code.

    - How do I install the myRemote client?
- Log in to myremote.io and click the client download link.
- Click on "Generate key" in the myremote.io panel and copy the key to your paste buffer.
- Run "python myRemote.py" in a terminal (or command prompt in Windows).
- Paste the key you generated earlier and hit return. Your device is now registered with your account and the device will appear in the myremote.io panel.

    - How do I use the myRemote.io panel?
Log in to the panel and see for yourself!

    - Who is behind myRemote? Can I help?
Two awesome developers, and support from an active community. If you want to help out, that's great, we can use people with more good ideas and skills. If you have front-end development skills we would be especially happy to hear from you!
