<p>myRemote is a free and open source tool to connect you to all your devices from a simple webinterface, which you can access anywhere, anytime. Take screenshots of your desktop, execute a range of useful scripts we made for you [FIXME: give some examples here], or create your own custom scripts if you want more freedom to do anything you want. </p>

Why should i trust you?</h1>

<p>Controlling your devices over the web is always dangerous. Therefor myRemote uses a secure connection from client to server. This is also known as TLS, and it gets your traffic safely to the other side. 
To keep your account safe, we have a few built-in options, if you are logged into your account, you can see a logbook where you can see from which IP and location your account was used from. In case you see a different IP, we advise you to change your password.
We are also working to get a two-factor authentication system. This is still in alpha testing, but myremote.io will be updated soon.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The myRemote client on the devices you want to be able to control. Supported OS'es are: Windows, OSX and Linux. Note that you will also need Python(2.7) to use the client.</li>
<li>An account on myremote.io. Registration is currently not yet open, but you can request an invite code.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Log in to myremote.io and click the client download link.</li>
<li>Click on "Generate key" in the myremote.io panel and copy the key to your paste buffer.</li>
<li>Run "python myRemote.py" in a terminal (or command prompt in Windows).</li>
<li>Paste the key you generated earlier and hit return. Your device is now registered with your account and the device will appear in the myremote.io panel.</li>
</ul>
